# Project Brief

The aim of the task is to code an interactive product card, on which the user can see the description and price of a leather wallet. The wallet is available in several color variants, and after selecting a color, the user sees a photo of the product in the selected color.

To complete the task,   I used the starter code provided in the assets package. I Used SCSS preprocessor and "pure" JavaScript (Vanilla JS).

In the final effect, the project met the following requirements:
*The default color will be salmon (the first one on the list). After selecting another color from the list, the circle of the new color will be marked, and the product image will show the wallet in the selected color (wallet photos in the appropriate colors were included in the Figma file)
*The page allows the user to add the product to the cart - after clicking the "Add to cart" button, the user sees a standard alert message saying "The {selected_color} wallet has been added to the cart"
*The page should be displayed properly on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
*The page properly handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user feels that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
